Ensure that the LANGSMITH_TRACING environment variable is set to 'true' to enable tracing, and also set the LANGSMITH_API_KEY environment variable with your API key. By default, traces will be logged to a project named \\\"default,\\\" but you can configure it to log to a different project if needed.\"),\n",
